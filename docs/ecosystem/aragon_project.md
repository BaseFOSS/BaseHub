# Aragon Project

Aragon builds flexible and secure tools that enable anyone to launch and manage Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). In 2016, Aragon built the first DAO framework, which has since powered the creation of over 6000 DAOs and secured over 13B in value for leading projects like Lido, Decentraland, API3, Aavegotchi and NFTX.
