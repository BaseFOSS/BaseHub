# Zellic

Zellic is a blockchain security firm solving the most critical software assurance problems. Our audits prevent business-ending hacks. We have identified and eliminated critical vulnerabilities in top projects, including Sui and Aptos Core, Solana SPL, and LayerZero that endangered billions of dollars. Before Zellic, we founded the #1 CTF (competitive hacking) team in the world.
