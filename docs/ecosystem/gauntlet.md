# Gauntlet

Since 2018, Gauntlet has managed risk for leading DeFi protocols. Our risk platform quantifies risk and runs economic stress tests. In 2021, Gauntlet launched a new team (Applied Research) that works with protocols on crypto-economic quantitative analysis, modeling, and optimization projects. Finally, in 2022, Gauntlet spun out Aera, a treasury management protocol to optimize DAO funds autonomously and onchain.
