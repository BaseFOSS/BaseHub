# WalletConnect

WalletConnect was founded with the mission to connect wallets and dapps, and the scope of our ambition has erupted along with the ecosystem. Today, WalletConnect is the communications protocol connecting web3, as we focus on assembling a messaging layer with our SDKs that enable authentication, push notifications, and wallet messaging. Our infrastructure and tools help developers build apps and expand experiences for the millions - and soon, billions - of users exploring the fast-growing world of web3.
