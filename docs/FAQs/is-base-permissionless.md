# Is Base permissionless?

Coinbase has staunchly defended the importance of Ethereum as a
permissionessless network. Theyâ€™ve defended this because developers and users
must be able to run and access open source software in a decentralized manner to
create an open, global, accessible cryptoeconomy.

The Base team has also written extensively about [their approach to
decentralization](https://base.mirror.xyz/H_KPwV31M7OJT-THUnU7wYjOF16Sy7aWvaEr5cgHi8I).

The goal of Base is to remove the friction points for onboarding the next
billion users into web3. While acting as a primary gateway to onchain activity,
Base will operate as a permissionless L2.
