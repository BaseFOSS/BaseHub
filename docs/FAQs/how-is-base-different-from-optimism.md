# How is Base different from Optimism?

Base is being built on the open source, MIT licensed OP Stack. But, will be
operating as two independent L2 chains. Optimism Mainnet remains the home for
the OP token and The Optimism Collective’s governance process. Base will be the
home for Coinbase’s onchain products, users, and assets, as well as an open
ecosystem for 3rd party developers to serve them.
