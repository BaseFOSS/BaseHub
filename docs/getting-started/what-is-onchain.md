# What does Onchain mean?

Onchain refers to all transactions and actions that occur directly on a
blockchain network, and Base is exactly this type of network. Activities are
recorded on a blockchain, and "onchain" is simply a shortened way of saying
this. The blockchain, "the chain," is a transparent, verifiable record of every
single transaction that has ever happened on the network.

## Components of an Onchain Transaction

### Transactions

In the context of an onchain network, transactions aren't just about
exchanging digital assets. They can also include other operations like deploying
a smart contract or making changes to data stored in the blockchain. Once a
transaction is validated and added onchain, it is permanently recorded
and cannot be altered.

### Blocks

A blockchain is composed of individual blocks. Each block contains a set of
transactions that have been validated by network participants. The block is
linked to the previous one, creating a chain of blocksâ€”hence the term
"blockchain."

## Why is Onchain Important?

Understanding Onchain is essential for several reasons:

### Transparency

Because all transactions are recorded on the public ledger, onchain networks
like Base offer unprecedented levels of transparency. Anyone can review the
transaction history, making the system highly transparent and accountable.

### Security

Onchain networks are typically decentralized, which means they don't rely on
a central point of control. This structure makes them highly resistant to
attacks and fraud. Once a transaction is recorded on the onchain, it cannot
be altered, providing a high level of security.

### Efficiency

Onchain can automate various processes, eliminating the need for
intermediaries and reducing costs and delays. This makes onchain technology
and transactions highly efficient.

### Verifiability

The unalterable nature of onchain transactions means that they can serve as
proof of all operations carried out on the blockchain. This can be particularly
useful in situations where verification and auditability are essential, such as
in financial services, digital ownership, self sovereignity and supply chain
management.

## The future is onchain

Onchain is a fundamental concept in understanding how blockchain networks like
Base operate. It refers to all the activities that take place directly on the
blockchain network and are recorded on the public ledger. This mechanism ensures
transparency, security, efficiency, and verifiability, making onchain
technology a disruptive force.

As we continue to embrace digital transformation, understanding concepts like
onchain is crucial for the innovators of tomorrow - who will become the leaders
and change-makers of the future that inherits our world of today.
