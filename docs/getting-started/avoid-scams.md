### Blackmail

Blackmail threats demanding Base tokens in exchange for not revealing personal
or damaging information have been observed. These are often delivered via email
or DMs claiming the hacker has sensitive data or footage. Typically, these
emails are sent en masse in hopes that someone will pay. Always exercise caution
and skepticism.

### Fake DEXs

With the growth of decentralized platforms, some fraudulent individuals create
fake decentralized exchanges. They may offer extremely attractive rates to lure
users. Always transact on reputable DEXs.

### Free Token Giveaways

Beware of offers or events that promise free tokens in return for a small
deposit, upon completion of tasks, or in exchange for your personal details.
Always double-check the authenticity of such promotions.

### Impersonation

Watch out for accounts on social platforms that impersonate well-known figures
or organizations in the Base community. Always verify the authenticity of
accounts and their claims before taking any action.

### Malware

Ensure that the software you use is from a legitimate source. Some malware can
alter Base addresses you copy-paste, redirecting your assets to the hacker's
address.

### In-Person Transactions

If you're considering buying or selling tokens in person, always meet in public
places and be wary of offers that sound too good to be true.

### Money Transfer Fraud

Be skeptical of unsolicited communications asking for Base tokens, especially if
they promise significant returns.

### Phishing Emails

Always be wary of emails asking you to reset passwords or provide any personal
information. Verify the sender's authenticity before acting on any email
instructions.

### Phishing Websites

Stay cautious of websites that impersonate legitimate Base or crypto-related
platforms. Ensure you're visiting the genuine site, especially before entering
sensitive information.

### Ponzi Schemes

Avoid "investment opportunities" that promise guaranteed returns. If it sounds
too good to be true, it probably is.

### Pyramid Schemes

Stay away from schemes that generate returns based on the number of new
participants rather than genuine investments.

### Prize Giveaways

Just as with free token giveaways, be skeptical of prize giveaways that ask for
personal information or any form of deposit.

### Pump and Dumps

Be cautious of individuals or groups promoting a token's price only to sell it
off after others have bought in.

### Ransomware

This malware type locks access to a user's system, demanding tokens as ransom.
Always be careful about the software you install.

### Scam Tokens

Some tokens might be promoted heavily, only to be schemes designed to defraud
people.
