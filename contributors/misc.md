## Developer PGP keys

The site may at times host the PGP/GPG keys for Base contributors.

**Note:** If a key is revoked, update the key with the revocation immediately.
Anyone with commit access to the site repository may do this without prior
review, but they should post the commit ID to an open issue or PR so other
people can review it. After the revoked key is uploaded, discussion about
verifying/adding a replacement key may continue at a slower pace.
