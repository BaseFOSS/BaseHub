# Become a Contributor

Here are some ways you can help:

* "[Watch](https://github.com/basefoss/basehub/subscription)" this repository
to be notified of issues and Pull Requests (PRs) that could use your attention.

* Help [write new documentation](https://basehub.org/) or **[review Issues
and/or PRs**. In many cases you don't need to be an expert -- many pages on
BaseHub are  written for non-experts, so we need to know if non-experts find
them confusing or incomplete. If you review a PR and don't find any problems
worth commenting about, leave a "Looks Good To Me (LGTM)" comment.

* Help improve BaseHub in another way. Open an issue and let us know how what
you're interested in and how you'd like to get involved.
