## What is Base?

Base is an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) network developed and incubated inside
Coinbase. Base is aimed to be a secure, low-cost, and developer-friendly
environment for building decentralized applications (dapps). The main goal of
Base is to make onchain the default online interaction, onboarding one million
developers and one billion users into the global cryptoeconomy.

### Features of Base

+ **Secure and Low-cost**: Base offers a secure environment to build dapps,
  minimizing costs for developers and users.
+ **Developer-Friendly**: Base is EVM-equivalent and is designed to be easily
  accessible to developers, offering a straightforward platform to build dapps.
+ **Built on Optimismâ€™s OP Stack**: Base leverages Optimism's technology to
  envision a standard, modular, rollup agnostic Superchain.
+ **No New Network Token**: Unlike other networks, Base does not plan to issue a
  new network token.
